# eqd-slots frontend application

The frontend application is written in plain old html and javascript/jquery. 
No fancy frameworks used here.

The frontend is pretty simple and just calls some REST services on the backend to make the game actualy do anything. 
The fancy animation stuff was taken from another spinwheel project.
